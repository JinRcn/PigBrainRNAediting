#Region-speciﬁc RNA editing identification

Region-speciﬁc-RNA-editing.pl
In order to investigate region-specific editing sites, three subcategories, including region enriched, group enriched and region enhanced, were defined

Tissue/Region enriched: At least Delta higher in a particular tissue/region than any other tissue/region
Group enriched: At least Delta higher in a group of tissues/regions (e.g. 2-4) than any other tissue/region
Tissue/Region enhanced: At least Delta higher in a particular tissue than the average levels of all tissues/regions
Note: Delta is the difference of editing level, e.g. 0.2 (20%)
